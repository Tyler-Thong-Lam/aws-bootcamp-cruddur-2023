## Required Homework

### Install AWS CLI

I am able to use Gitpod or Github Codespaces; however, I have quite a lot of problem with Gitpod due to my mistakes.

   First of all 
   
   ```
   curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
   unzip awscliv2.zip
   sudo ./aws/install
    
   ```
