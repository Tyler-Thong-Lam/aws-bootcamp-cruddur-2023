# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Install AWS CLI

I am able to use Gitpod or Github Codespaces; however, I have quite a lot of problem with Gitpod due to my mistakes.  

When learning how to generate Credentials, Budget and Billing Alarm via CLI, I did not commit my ```gitpod.yml```  after the instalation through the Gitpod.  After completing the whole exercises through Gitpod, I was unable to commit the code to my Github resporitory (the process of commiting keep loading-See picture)
   
   *Note for the photos* 
   
To fix that, I go back and watch the tutorial and re-do the whole thing from the beginning; that is the moment that I figure out that  I made mistake.  Lesson learned

From the video, I learned so much more information about the AWS CLI. I have never used the CLI before; therefore, this is a really good chance for me to know and learn about AWS.

### Creating Admin user, Billing Alarm, Budgets

For creating Admin user, Billing Alarm, and Budgets, I have no issue with this because I have learned and read about these features before.
